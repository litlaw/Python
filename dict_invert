//function called dict_invert that takes in a dictionary with immutable values and returns the inverse of the dictionary. 
//The inverse of a dictionary d is another dictionary whose keys are the unique dictionary values in d. 
//The value for a key in the inverse dictionary is a sorted list (increasing order) 
//of all keys in d that have the same value in d.
